# Navigation Bar Scroll Behavior Implementation

## Overview
The navigation bar has been modified to implement sophisticated scroll-based visibility behavior as follows:

## Behavior Description

### Initial State (Page Load)
- The navigation bar is **visible** at the top of the page
- The hero section has proper padding to account for the fixed nav bar
- No content sits under the navigation bar

### Hide After Scrolling Down 50px
- When user scrolls down more than 50 pixels from the top
- The nav bar slides up smoothly and hides
- Only triggers on downward scroll movement beyond the 50px threshold

### Show on Any Upward Scroll
- When the user scrolls up from **any point** on the website
- The nav bar slides down and becomes visible immediately
- Works regardless of current scroll position (could be at bottom of page)
- Only responds to significant scroll movements (±10px threshold)
- Ignores small jitters and momentum scrolling

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Classes Added (in `globals.css`)
```css
.hide-nav {
  transform: translateY(-100%);
  pointer-events: none;
  visibility: hidden;
}

.nav-transition {
  transition: transform 250ms ease-in-out, visibility 250ms ease-in-out;
}

.hero-nav-padding {
  padding-top: var(--navigation-height);
}
```

### JavaScript Logic (in `header.tsx`)

1. **State Management**: Tracks navigation visibility (starts visible)
2. **Scroll Direction Detection**: Throttled scroll handler (100ms) with ±10px threshold
3. **50px Threshold**: Hides nav only after scrolling down more than 50px from top
4. **Upward Scroll Detection**: Shows nav immediately on any upward scroll movement
5. **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensures nav is visible when any nav element receives focus
6. **Static Padding**: Hero section has fixed padding since nav starts visible

### Key Features

- **Performance Optimized**: Throttled scroll handling and passive event listeners
- **Accessibility Compliant**: 
  - Navigation visible on keyboard focus
  - `pointer-events: none` when hidden
  - Proper `visibility` management
- **Mobile Friendly**: 
  - Works with momentum scrolling
  - Handles orientation changes
  - Responsive design maintained
- **No Layout Shift**: Dynamic padding compensation prevents CLS

### Edge Cases Handled

- ✅ Window resize and mobile orientation changes
- ✅ Keyboard-only navigation (nav visible on focus)
- ✅ Momentum/rubber-band scrolling on touch devices
- ✅ No Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- ✅ High z-index ensures nav stays above content
- ✅ Throttled event handling for performance

## Integration Notes

The implementation is fully integrated into the existing React/Next.js structure:
- Uses React hooks for state management
- Preserves existing hamburger menu functionality
- Maintains all existing styling and responsive behavior
- No markup changes required - only CSS and JavaScript logic added

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Nav starts visible on page load
- [ ] Nav stays visible when scrolling less than 50px
- [ ] Nav hides when scrolling down past 50px from top
- [ ] Nav shows immediately on any upward scroll (from any position)
- [ ] Ignores small scroll movements (<10px)
- [ ] Works after window resize
- [ ] Works with keyboard navigation
- [ ] No layout shift when nav appears/hides
- [ ] Works on mobile with momentum scrolling
